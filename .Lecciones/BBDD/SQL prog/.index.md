## Basics

SQL offers a series of scripting and programming features, some of them common to other languages.

## Functions

A function is a stored script returning a sole value. Their purpose is to encapsulate useful and commonly used pieces of code.

## Triggers

A trigger is a little script linked to a table which will activate and do its thing every time the table suffers an event *(insertion, deletion, modification)*.
