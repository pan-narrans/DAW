## Basics

### Connect to XML

---
This goes at the top of the XML file:

```xml
<?xml-stylesheet href="test1.xsl" type="text/xsl"?>
```

### Preview changes

---

Open the XML document in internet explorer.

### Move around the XML doc

---

We move around the XML and select items like we would in a console, using:
| symbol | meaning                     |
| :----: | --------------------------- |
|   .    | the current node            |
|   ..   | parent node                 |
|   *    | all elements of the level   |
|   @*   | all attributes of the level |
| e1/e2  | e2, direct child of e1      |
| e1//e2 | all e2, children of e1      |

It's possible to use both **absolute paths** and **relative paths** when selecting elements. When working with relative paths it's really important to be aware of where exactly we are on the XML tree.

Examples:

- The root of the XML is: `/root`
- All children of the root are: `/root/*`
- All siblings of an element from that same element: `../*`

### HTML

---

We can add HTML syntax almost anywhere inside the XML document.
